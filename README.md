# android-api-demo

This is the final project for my cloud/mobile development class. It's a cloud-backed Android app that allows users to create accounts and keep track of their weightlifting records. It was written over the course of about 1 week.

I wrote a <a href="http://seifert-mobile.appspot.com">simple public API</a>, hosted on Google App Engine. It does not include caching (this was not covered in class), but otherwise conforms to most RESTful principles.

The purpose of the project was to create an application that interacts meaningfully with an API of our own construction; the focus was on demonstrating different types of POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests, and considerations like aesthetics were not emphasized.

If you'd like to view the application in action, I have a ~5 minute demo of the application running <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~seiferjo/CS496/finalDemo.mp4">here</a>.
